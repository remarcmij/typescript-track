# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a TypeScript learning track for the HackYourFuture curriculum. The target audience is trainees who know JavaScript and will be learning TypeScript for use with React.

## File Structure

- `topics.md` — topic outline defining the TypeScript concepts to be covered
- `TYPESCRIPT.md` — main learning document with a section per topic (type system, generics, utility types, type guards, etc.)
- `TOOLING.md` — how to install and run TypeScript (Node.js native type stripping, `tsx`, and `tsc`)

## Current State

No build system, tests, linting, or source code exists yet. The repository is documentation-only curriculum content.
